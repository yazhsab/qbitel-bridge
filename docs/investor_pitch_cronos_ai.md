# CRONOS AI Investor Pitch

## Executive Summary
- **Mission**: Safeguard the world's legacy-critical infrastructure from quantum-era threats without forcing risky rip-and-replace projects.
- **Product**: A zero-touch, AI-driven security mesh that learns undocumented protocols in 72 hours, applies quantum-safe encryption, and orchestrates autonomous response across mixed legacy and modern estates.
- **Stage**: Core platform architecture 65% complete with security stack, dashboard, and zero-touch operational plane production-ready; LLM-enhanced modules entering build phase for Q1 2026 GA.
- **Capital Ask**: $18M Series A to accelerate AI engine completion, scale go-to-market, and certify quantum-safe deployments across regulated industries.
- **Why Now**: NIST PQC mandates, accelerating "harvest-now-decrypt-later" campaigns, and a $22B market urgency for post-quantum remediation create a narrow window for a deployable solution.

## The Problem: Legacy Lock-In Meets Quantum Threat
- Critical infrastructure (finance, energy, healthcare, government) runs on 20-40 year old protocols with no vendor support or upgrade path.
- IBM, Google, and national labs forecast cryptographically relevant quantum computers by 2030-2033, rendering RSA/ECC encryption unusable.
- Enterprises face multi-year, nine-figure modernization projects that historically fail 60% of the time and carry $5M/hour downtime exposure.
- Regulatory pressure from NIST PQC, PCI-DSS 4.0, Fed Reserve guidance, and EU CRA demands demonstrable transition plans within the next 24 months.

## Solution: CRONOS AI Quantum-Safe Integration Layer
- Passive learning engine mirrors production traffic to build full protocol grammars without code changes.
- Quantum-safe edge applies PQC (Kyber, Dilithium) on the wire via cryptographic shim, backed by HSM-integrated key orchestration.
- Zero-touch security orchestrator coordinates AI-driven detection, SOAR automation, and compliance evidence across Splunk/QRadar/Sentinel.
- Unified LLM layer powers protocol intelligence copilots, autonomous compliance reporting, and API translation to unlock brownfield-to-cloud integration.

## Product Highlights
- **Protocol Intelligence Copilot**: Natural language interface over undocumented protocols; halves integration timelines (CRONOS_AI_LLM_FEATURES_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md:12).
- **Zero-Touch Security Orchestrator**: Production-ready SOAR workflows with ML-driven policy engine and behavioural analytics (ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md:1).
- **Protocol Translation Studio**: Generates modern APIs from legacy message definitions, enabling modernization without downtime (CRONOS_AI_LLM_FEATURES_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md:6).
- **Quantum Crypto Core**: PQC TLS wrapper with Kyber-768/Dilithium support, hardware HSM integration, and automated key lifecycle (ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md:43).
- **Production Dashboard**: Real-time AI operations, threat intelligence, and model health monitoring shipped at 100% completion (DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md:1).

## Market Opportunity
- **Total Addressable Market**: $22B global spend on post-quantum security migration (Gartner, IDC forecasts through 2030).
- **Serviceable Available Market**: $8B across top 200 global banks, tier-1 energy, and critical healthcare networks requiring protocol-level remediation.
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market**: $800M focused on 60 enterprises with regulatory deadlines before 2028 and existing mainframe/SCADA dependence.
- Market dynamics include regulatory mandates, rising "harvest-now" incidents, and lack of alternatives that avoid code rewrites.

## Traction & Validation
- **Engineering Milestones**: Enterprise security stack, dashboard, and zero-touch orchestration delivered to production spec (security + UI documentation complete).
- **Pilot Readiness**: Passive discovery engine operating in emulated ISO-8583 and SCADA environments with >99% parse accuracy during internal tests (README.md:36).
- **Partnership Motion**: Engaged with HSM vendors and SIEM providers for co-selling and validation labs (ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md:34).
- **Compliance Roadmap**: Automated SOC2/ISO27001 evidence collection and PQC readiness scoring, aligning with 2026 audit cycles.

## Competitive Advantage
- **Zero-Touch Deployment**: Mirror-based learning removes operational risk inherent in competitor rip-and-replace upgrades.
- **AI + PQC Fusion**: Only platform pairing autonomous protocol discovery with quantum-safe encryption and SOAR automation.
- **LLM Layered Intelligence**: Feature roadmap extends defense with copilots, compliance automation, and protocol translation studio.
- **Enterprise Hardening**: Demonstrated production readiness across dashboard, HSM integration, SIEM, and SOAR workflows.

## Business Model
- Enterprise subscription with modular pricing:
  - Core platform: $650k ARR per site (includes PQC mesh, protocol discovery, and security orchestration).
  - LLM feature bundle: +$180k ARR for copilots, compliance reporter, translation studio.
  - Professional services: $250k fixed for assessment and integration sprint, with gross margin >55% via playbook automation.
- Expansion levers through additional protocols, new sites, and consumption-based API translation.

## Go-To-Market Strategy
- Land with regulated design partners (top 20 banks, critical infrastructure) via 90-day paid proof-of-value that delivers compliance-ready remediation plans.
- Channel alliances with HSM vendors, SIEM integrators, and global consultancies to leverage regulatory mandates.
- Thought leadership through quantum readiness assessments and industry-specific playbooks (banking, grid, healthcare).
- Post-Series A build dedicated customer reliability team and regulatory affairs function to accelerate certifications.

## Financial Projections (Illustrative)

| Fiscal Year | Customers | ARR ($M) | Gross Margin | Burn ($M) | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| FY2026 (launch) | 6 | 5.1 | 63% | 9.5 | Design partners convert post-PoV; services cover onboarding.
| FY2027 | 16 | 14.8 | 68% | 12.2 | LLM upsells + second-site expansions drive NRR >130%.
| FY2028 | 32 | 32.4 | 72% | 15.0 | International expansion, healthcare entry, positive contribution margin.

_Assumptions: median 1.3 sites/customer by FY2027; churn <5% due to regulatory lock-in; services blended margin 40%._
