# CRONOS AI Investor Deck

---
## Slide 1 – Title & Vision
- CRONOS AI: Quantum-safe shield for legacy-critical infrastructure
- Mission: Deploy zero-touch security that future-proofs trillions in legacy assets
- Presenters: Founding team (national security crypto, mainframe modernization, AI scale)

---
## Slide 2 – The Quantum Shockwave
- Cryptographically relevant quantum machines expected by 2030-2033
- RSA/ECC lifetimes collapsing as "harvest-now, decrypt-later" campaigns accelerate
- Regulated sectors forced to show post-quantum roadmaps within 24 months

---
## Slide 3 – Legacy Lock-In Crisis
- 70% of financial transactions still run on COBOL mainframes (README.md:36)
- SCADA, grid, and medical protocols lack documentation and vendor support
- Modernization projects cost $50M-$100M and fail 60% of the time
- Downtime exposure exceeds $5M/hour for tier-1 operations

---
## Slide 4 – Market Opportunity
- $22B TAM for post-quantum remediation; $8B SAM in banks/energy/healthcare
- NIST PQC, PCI-DSS 4.0, Fed Reserve guidance compel immediate action
- Enterprises seek solutions that avoid code rewrites and certification delays

---
## Slide 5 – CRONOS AI Platform
- Passive discovery mirrors traffic, learning undocumented protocols in days
- Quantum-safe edge applies Kyber/Dilithium encryption with HSM-backed keys
- Zero-touch orchestrator aligns SIEM, SOAR, and compliance automation
- Unified LLM layer powers copilots, compliance reporting, translation studio

---
## Slide 6 – Product Modules
- Protocol Intelligence Copilot: NLQ over legacy protocols; halves integration cycles
- Zero-Touch Security Orchestrator: ML policy engine + SOAR playbooks (ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md:1)
- Protocol Translation Studio: Generates modern APIs from legacy schemas
- Production Dashboard: Live AI ops, threat intelligence, model health (DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md:11)

---
## Slide 7 – Traction & Validation
- Security stack, dashboard, and SOAR workflows production-ready
- Internal pilots: ISO-8583/SCADA emulations >99% parse accuracy (README.md:36)
- SIEM/HSM partners engaged for co-selling and validation labs
- Compliance automation aligned with SOC2/ISO27001/PQC mandates

---
## Slide 8 – Business Model
- Core subscription: $650k ARR per site (PQC mesh + discovery + orchestration)
- LLM feature bundle: +$180k ARR; protocol translation consumption add-ons
- Professional services: $250k quantum readiness sprint; >55% GM through playbooks
- Expansion via multi-site rollouts, new protocol packs, managed SOC offering

---
## Slide 9 – Go-To-Market Engine
- 90-day paid proofs-of-value convert regulated design partners
- Channel leverage: HSM vendors, SIEM integrators, global consultancies
- Thought leadership: quantum readiness index, sector-specific playbooks
- Post-Series A: customer reliability + regulatory affairs to scale certifications

---
## Slide 10 – Financial Outlook
- FY2026: 6 customers, $5.1M ARR, 63% GM; services fund onboarding
- FY2027: 16 customers, $14.8M ARR, 68% GM; NRR >130%
- FY2028: 32 customers, $32.4M ARR, 72% GM; positive contribution margin
- Conservative churn (<5%) thanks to compliance lock-in and mission-critical footprint

---
## Slide 11 – Funding Ask & Use
- Raising $18M Series A for 18-24 month runway
- 45% product/AI completion, 25% GTM hiring, 20% certifications & partnerships, 10% working capital
- Unlock GA launch, FedRAMP pathway, and multi-vertical expansion

---
## Slide 12 – Roadmap & Milestones
- Q4 2025: Protocol discovery MVP + closed beta with top banks
- Q1 2026: GA with LLM bundle; SOC2 Type I + PQC readiness reports
- Q3 2026: Energy & healthcare launch; automated translation studio live
- Q1 2027: FedRAMP Moderate, managed SOC offering via MSSP partners

---
## Slide 13 – Team & Advisors
- Deep expertise across national security cryptography, AI infra, mainframe upgrades
- Advisors: former NIST PQC working group member, Fortune 50 bank CISO, ex-Google quantum lead
- Hiring roadmap: AI research, PQC hardware acceleration, regulated sales leadership

---
## Slide 14 – Closing & Call to Action
