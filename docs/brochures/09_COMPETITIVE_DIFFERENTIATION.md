# QBITEL — Competitive Differentiation

> What We Do That Nobody Else Can

---

## The Market Gap

The cybersecurity market is $200B+ and growing. Hundreds of vendors protect modern cloud infrastructure. **Zero vendors** protect the legacy systems that run the world's critical operations — and none are quantum-ready.

QBITEL sits in the white space between legacy infrastructure and quantum-era threats.

### vs. Claroty / Dragos (OT Security)

| Dimension | Claroty/Dragos | QBITEL |
|---|---|---|

| **Healthcare** | Limited | Full medical device PQC (64KB devices) |
| **Compliance** | OT frameworks | 9 frameworks (OT + IT + finance + health) |
| **Best for** | OT-only visibility | Unified security with quantum protection |

**When to choose QBITEL**: You need quantum-safe OT security, or unified IT/OT protection, or medical device coverage.

---

### vs. IBM Quantum Safe / PQShield (PQC Vendors)

| Dimension | IBM QS / PQShield | QBITEL |
|---|---|---|
| **PQC** | Yes | Yes (same NIST algorithms) |
| **Protocol discovery** | None | AI-powered, 2–4 hours |
| **Autonomous response** | None | 78% autonomous |
| **Legacy integration** | Manual | Automated (COBOL, mainframe, SCADA) |
| **Domain optimization** | Generic | Healthcare (64KB), automotive (<10ms), aviation (600bps) |
| **Compliance** | Crypto compliance only | 9 full frameworks |
| **Best for** | PQC library integration | Full security platform with PQC |

**When to choose QBITEL**: You need PQC as part of a complete security platform, not just a cryptographic library.

## The Seven Things Only QBITEL Does

### 1. AI Protocol Discovery
Learns undocumented, proprietary protocols from raw network traffic in 2–4 hours. No documentation, no vendor support, no reverse engineering team. 89%+ accuracy on first pass.

### 2. Domain-Optimized Post-Quantum Cryptography
Not one-size-fits-all PQC. Implementations tuned for:
- 64KB RAM medical devices
- <10ms V2X automotive messages
- 600bps aviation data links
- <1ms SCADA control loops
- 10,000+ TPS banking transactions

### 3. Agentic AI Security (Not Playbooks)
An LLM that reasons about threats with business context, not a SOAR that follows scripts. It understands that shutting down a SCADA system is different from blocking an IP. 78% autonomous. 12% escalated to humans.

### 4. Legacy System Protection
The only platform that secures COBOL mainframes, 3270 terminals, CICS transactions, DB2 databases, and MQ Series — without changing a line of legacy code.

### 5. Air-Gapped Autonomous AI
Full LLM-powered security operations without any cloud connectivity. Ollama with Llama 3.2 (70B) running on-premise. Essential for defense, classified, and critical infrastructure.

### 6. Translation Studio
Point at any protocol, get a REST API + SDKs in Python, Java, Go, C#, Rust, and TypeScript. Auto-generated. Fully documented. Minutes, not months.

### 7. Unified Compliance Across 9 Frameworks
One platform generates audit-ready evidence for PCI-DSS 4.0, HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, NERC CIP, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, DORA, and CMMC. Reports in <10 minutes.

## Summary

QBITEL is not competing for the same market as CrowdStrike or Palo Alto. It occupies a **new category**: AI-powered quantum-safe security for the legacy and constrained systems that traditional vendors cannot protect. For organizations running critical operations on aging infrastructure — which is most of the Fortune 500 — it's not a choice between QBITEL and a competitor. It's a choice between QBITEL and nothing.
