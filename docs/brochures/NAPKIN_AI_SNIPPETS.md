### Snippet 6: Three Problems We Solve

```
QBITEL Solves 3 Converging Crises

Problem 1: The Legacy Crisis
- 60% of Fortune 500 run operations on 20-40 year old systems
- COBOL mainframes process $3 trillion daily
- No existing security vendor protects these systems
- Modernization projects cost $50M-$100M and fail 60% of the time

Problem 2: The Quantum Crisis
- Quantum computers will break RSA and ECDSA within 5-10 years
- "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks happening today
- Every wire transfer, patient record, and grid command is at risk
- No major security vendor offers quantum-safe protection

Problem 3: The Speed Crisis
- Average SOC response time: 65 minutes
- In 65 minutes, attackers exfiltrate 100GB of data
- Human-speed security cannot match machine-speed attacks
- 67% analyst turnover from alert fatigue

QBITEL is the only platform solving all three simultaneously.

### Snippet 28: Aviation — Bandwidth Challenge

```
QBITEL Aviation: Solving the Bandwidth Problem

Aviation data links are extremely constrained. Classical PQC signatures are too large. QBITEL compresses them.

ADS-B (1090ES):
- Available: 112 bits per message
- Classical PQC: Not feasible (signatures too large)
- QBITEL: Compressed authentication tag fits

LDACS (Air-Ground):
- Available: 600 bps to 2.4 kbps
- Classical PQC: Not feasible
- QBITEL: Optimized Dilithium with 60% compression

ACARS (Operational Messages):
- Available: 2.4 kbps
- Classical PQC: Marginal, very slow
- QBITEL: Compressed and batched signatures

SATCOM (Satellite):
- Available: 10 to 128 kbps
- Classical PQC: Feasible but slow
- QBITEL: Full PQC with compression

AeroMACS (Airport Surface):
- Available: 10 Mbps
- Classical PQC: Feasible
- QBITEL: Full Kyber-1024 + Dilithium-5

QBITEL signature compression: Up to 60% reduction while maintaining NIST security levels.

Aircraft operate for 25-40 years. They WILL encounter quantum computers. They need protection now.

### Snippet 29: Aviation — ADS-B Authentication

```
QBITEL: Securing ADS-B

Current ADS-B problem:
- ADS-B broadcasts aircraft position, altitude, speed, and identity
- Zero authentication — any $20 SDR radio can inject false positions
- Ghost aircraft can be created, real aircraft can be spoofed
- Air traffic controllers cannot distinguish real from fake

QBITEL ADS-B Authentication:

Layer 1: Position Authentication
- Cryptographic binding of aircraft ID to position reports
- Every genuine aircraft position is signed

Layer 2: Spoofing Detection
- AI-powered multilateration cross-validation
- Position checked against multiple ground receivers
- Inconsistencies flagged in less than 100ms

Layer 3: Ghost Injection Defense
- Statistical anomaly detection on ADS-B message patterns
- Ghost aircraft have different signal characteristics
- AI identifies patterns humans cannot see

Layer 4: Ground Network Protection
- PQC-authenticated ground stations
- Compromised ground equipment cannot inject false data

Result: Air traffic controllers can trust what they see on radar.
Detection speed: Less than 100ms for spoofed aircraft.
Zero changes to aircraft equipment required — ground-side deployment first.

### Snippet 30: Telecom — Carrier Scale

```
QBITEL Telecom: Security at Carrier Scale

Scale challenge:
- 100M+ subscribers per carrier
- Billions of IoT devices connected
- Millions of signaling messages per second
- Multiple protocol generations coexisting

QBITEL carrier-grade performance:
- Throughput: 150,000 crypto operations per second
- Latency: Less than 2ms per operation
- Availability: 99.9999% (six nines)
- Scalability: Horizontal, handles billions of sessions

Protocols protected:
- SS7 (1975): Still carries signaling for most world calls — location tracking, call interception risk
- Diameter (4G/5G): Authentication and billing — subscriber impersonation risk
- SIP (Voice/Video): Session control — eavesdropping, toll fraud risk
- GTP (Data): Mobile tunneling — data interception risk
- RADIUS (Enterprise): AAA services — credential theft risk
- PFCP (5G): User plane — traffic manipulation risk
- HTTP/2 SBI (5G): Service interfaces — API abuse risk

Key advantage: Network-layer protection.
No changes to billions of endpoint devices.
Protect at the network, not at the device.

### Snippet 31: Telecom — 5G Network Slice Security

```
QBITEL: Per-Slice 5G Security

5G introduces network slicing — multiple virtual networks on shared infrastructure.
Each slice has different requirements. Each gets different security.

Slice 1: eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)
- Use: Video streaming, web browsing
- Security: Standard PQC encryption, traffic analysis protection
- Priority: Throughput over latency

Slice 2: URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency)
- Use: Remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, industrial control
- Security: Optimized PQC with less than 1ms overhead
- Priority: Latency and reliability critical

Slice 3: mMTC (Massive Machine Type Communications)
- Use: Smart meters, sensors, agricultural IoT
- Security: Lightweight PQC, battery-optimized
- Priority: Scale and power efficiency

Slice 4: Enterprise Private Slice
- Use: Corporate networks, campus security
- Security: Custom PQC policy per tenant
- Priority: Isolation and compliance

Slice 5: Critical Communications
- Use: Public safety, emergency services
- Security: Maximum quantum-safe protection, air-gapped option
- Priority: Security and availability above all

Each slice independently secured. Compromising one slice cannot affect another.
