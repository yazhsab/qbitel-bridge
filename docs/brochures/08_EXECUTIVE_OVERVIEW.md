# QBITEL — Executive Overview

> AI-Powered Quantum-Safe Security for the Systems the World Runs On

---

## One Platform. Ten Capabilities. Every System Protected.

QBITEL is the first unified security platform that discovers, protects, and autonomously defends both legacy and modern systems against current and quantum-era threats.

---

## The Three Problems We Solve

### 1. The Legacy Problem
**60% of Fortune 500 companies** run critical operations on systems built 20–40 years ago — COBOL mainframes, SCADA controllers, proprietary protocols. These systems process trillions of dollars daily but have zero modern security. Nobody else protects them.

### 2. The Quantum Problem
Quantum computers will break RSA and ECDSA encryption within 5–10 years. Attackers are already harvesting encrypted data today to decrypt later. Every wire transfer, patient record, and grid command encrypted with classical crypto is a future breach waiting to happen.

### 3. The Speed Problem
The average security team takes 65 minutes to respond to a threat. In that time, an attacker can exfiltrate 100GB of data, encrypt an entire network, or manipulate industrial controls. Human-speed security cannot match machine-speed attacks.

## How We Solve Them

| Capability | What It Does | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Protocol Discovery** | Learns unknown protocols from traffic in 2–4 hours | 1,000x faster than manual reverse engineering |
| **Post-Quantum Cryptography** | NIST Level 5 encryption (Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5) | Quantum-safe today, not someday |
| **Zero-Touch Security** | 78% autonomous threat response, <10 sec total | 390x faster than manual SOC |
| **Translation Studio** | Auto-generates REST APIs + 6 SDKs from any protocol | Minutes vs. months of integration |
| **Protocol Marketplace** | 1,000+ pre-built protocol adapters | Instant deployment |
| **Cloud Migration Security** | End-to-end quantum-safe encryption for cloud journeys | Mainframe to cloud, protected |
| **Compliance Automation** | 9 frameworks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NERC CIP, DORA...) | <10 min reports, 98% audit pass |
| **On-Premise AI** | Air-gapped LLM (Ollama/vLLM) | No cloud dependency |
| **Self-Healing** | Health checks every 30s, auto-recovery | 99.999% availability |
| **Threat Intelligence** | MITRE ATT&CK mapping, continuous learning | Adapts to new threats |

## Why Not the Competition?

| | QBITEL | CrowdStrike | Palo Alto | Fortinet |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Legacy system protection | Yes (40+ year systems) | No | No | No |
| Quantum-safe crypto | NIST Level 5 | None | None | None |
| AI protocol discovery | 2–4 hours | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Autonomous response | 78% auto, <10s | Manual playbooks | Manual playbooks | Manual playbooks |
| Air-gapped AI | On-premise LLM | Cloud-only | Cloud-only | Cloud-only |
| Domain-optimized PQC | 64KB devices, <10ms V2X, 600bps aviation | Generic | Generic | Generic |
| Protocol marketplace | 1,000+ adapters | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Nobody else combines AI discovery + quantum crypto + autonomous response + legacy support + air-gapped operation.**
