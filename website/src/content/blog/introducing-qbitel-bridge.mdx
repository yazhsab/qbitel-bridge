Today marks a milestone for the QBITEL project. We are publicly releasing **QBITEL Bridge**, our open-source platform for modernizing legacy infrastructure using AI-powered protocol discovery and post-quantum cryptography. Rather than forcing organizations to rewrite decades of mission-critical code, QBITEL Bridge wraps existing systems in a secure, observable bridge layer that makes them quantum-safe and interoperable with modern architectures.

## Why We Built This

Enterprises across finance, healthcare, government, and manufacturing depend on legacy protocols that were designed long before today's security landscape existed. Many of these protocols are proprietary, undocumented, and deeply embedded in operational workflows. Replacing them wholesale is expensive, risky, and often impossible under regulatory constraints.

QBITEL Bridge takes a different approach. Instead of replacing legacy systems, it discovers their communication patterns autonomously and builds translation layers that expose them through modern, quantum-safe interfaces. The result is continuity without compromise.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Protocol Discovery** -- a five-phase AI pipeline that captures, clusters, and classifies unknown protocol traffic with 89%+ accuracy across more than 150 protocols.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography** -- NIST Level 5 protection using ML-KEM-1024 and ML-DSA-87, applied at the bridge layer so legacy endpoints require no modification.
- **Zero-Touch Security Orchestration** -- AI agents that continuously monitor, assess, and respond to threats without manual intervention.
- **Protocol Translation Studio** -- a visual environment for mapping legacy message formats to REST, gRPC, and GraphQL interfaces.
- **Rust Data Plane** -- a high-performance packet processing layer built on DPDK for line-rate inspection and forwarding.

## Why Open Source

Security infrastructure should be auditable. By releasing QBITEL Bridge under an open-source license, we invite the community to inspect every cryptographic implementation, every AI model decision path, and every protocol handler. Transparency is not just a value statement; it is a security requirement.

We also believe that the legacy modernization problem is too large for any single vendor. Open-sourcing the core platform allows domain experts in banking, healthcare, energy, and manufacturing to contribute protocol definitions, compliance modules, and integration connectors that benefit the entire ecosystem.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository from GitHub, follow the quickstart guide in the README, and deploy a local instance in under ten minutes. The documentation covers everything from single-node development setups to production Kubernetes deployments with Istio service mesh integration.

We are excited to build this in the open and welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the community.
