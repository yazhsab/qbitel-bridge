Although concrete details of the attacks are not yet public, Google made reference to a number of Gmail accounts that were compromised during or after the attacks. Anatomy of the Attack For a number of years targeted attacks have nearly always followed the same modus operandi. In the more sophisticated attacks, the attacker will use a new zero day vulnerability, as obviously this will have a greater success rate. In this attack a PDF file was used to exploit the Adobe Acrobat, Reader, and Flash Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2009-1862\/BID35759). This PDF installed a Trojan horse which was an earlier version of the current Trojan.Hydraq. This means the remote attacker has the ability to see in real time any user interface activity as if they were sitting right next to the user. As described in the previously posted blog (Hydraq - An Attack of Mythical Proportions), an unpatched Internet Explorer vulnerability (BID 37815) was used as one of the propagation vectors for this particular Trojan.Hydraq attack. This security hole allows remote exploitation, which means that attackers can run any malicious code of their liking on a victim\u2019s machine by taking advantage of the vulnerability. The number of computers we have observed being attacked or have been attacked is low as borne out by our field detection statistics.

Strangely, in one case, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain name similar to the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be from CFR. If the exploit is successful, the threat actors will attempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT. Its called the \"packager trick\" because any file embedded in an RTF file using packager will be automatically dropped to the %tmp% folder (c:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp) when the RTF document is opened.

This PDF installed a Trojan horse which was an earlier version of the current Trojan.Hydraq.

This means the remote attacker has the ability to see in real time any user interface activity as if they were sitting right next to the user.

Since before the loop\u00a0FreeConsole has been called all printf calls do basically nothing: This code has been directly copied from the documentation of printf: So what is the purpose of those numerous\u00a0printf loops. As a result, the massive amount of calls delay the execution process and overload the sandbox with junk data. This behavior is called API Hammering. API Hammering is not a new technique, we have already seen it several years ago e.g. Joe Sandbox detects the API hammering successfully and rates it as malicious: Right after the printf flood, the sample performs another loop to delay execution by creating and writing to a temporary file - the second stage.

{"text1":"In their example, the OilRig group used a malicious macro document to deliver the backdoor, which is a tactic much more commonly used by them. A closer examination revealed the obfuscation used by the OilRig group in these QUADAGENT samples were likely the result of using an open-source toolkit called Invoke-Obfuscation. This tool was originally intended to aid defenders in simulating obfuscated PowerShell commands to better their defenses. Invoke-Obfuscation has proven to be highly effective at obfuscating PowerShell scripts and in this case, the adversary was able to take advantage of the tool for increased chances of evasion and as an anti-analysis tactic. Based on our telemetry, we have high confidence the email account used to launch this attack was compromised by the OilRig group, likely via credential theft. The file appears to have been compiled using a bat2exe tool, which will take batch files (.bat) and convert them to PE (.exe) files. Its sole purpose here is to install the QUADAGENT backdoor and execute it.

The attacker implements indirect API calls by using GetProcAddress() and LoadLibrary() API.

PowerLoader gets the malicious code into the process by opening an existing, shared section already mapped into explorer, removing the need to allocate heap space or overwrite process memory. By opening \u201cShell_TrayWnd\u201d and calling SetWindowLong, PowerLoader is able to set a variable used by the window procedure to point to a specific address in its shellcode. The read part won\u2019t trigger DEP (Data Execution Prevention), if the section is not executable (in later versions of windows it is execute-protected), however if EAX points to an address inside the section, DEP will be triggered. Well how does one get from KiUserApcDispatcher to code execution, without executing the non-executable shellcode, I hear you ask. Next it pops the return address into the EAX and then calls it, this results in execution being transferred back to the Window Procedure. The sequences are instruction within the executable regions of explorer\u2019s memory, their purpose is to perform certain operations as PowerLoader can\u2019t execute any of its own code yet, due to the section being execute-protected. 00100E28 points to some code in explorer that executes the instruction \u201cSTD\u201d followed by \u201cRET\u201d, As a result the instruction underlined in red will result in the direction flag being set and execution being returned to the Window Procedure.

Over the past 1.5 years I\u2019ve been doing quite a lot of exploration into Azure AD and how it works under the hood. So I set myself a few goals: - Provide tooling for both Red teams and Blue teams to explore all Azure AD data in an accessible way. Use asynchronous HTTP calls in Python to dump all available information in the Azure AD graph to this database. Where to get the data . Since Azure AD is a cloud service, there isn\u2019t a way to reverse engineer how it works, or a central repository where all the data is stored that you can access. While researching Azure and looking through the requests in the Azure Portal, at some point I noticed that the portal was calling a different version of the Azure AD Graph, the 1.61-internal version. This internal version of the Azure AD graph exposes much more data than any of the official API\u2019s that are offered by Microsoft. To create the object structure, ROADrecon uses the OData metadata definition that the Azure AD graph exposes. ROADrecon will by default pretend to be the Azure AD PowerShell module and will thus inherit its permissions to access the internal version of the Azure AD graph. Gathering all the data . The second step is data gathering, which the roadrecon gather command does. That being said, there is a setting in the deprecated MSOnline PowerShell module which prevents enumeration using the Azure AD graph, which is documented here","labels":"['T1119']"}

The uniqueness of the recent attack observed by Intezer is the group abuses a legitimate open source tool called Weave Scope to gain full control over the victim\u2019s cloud infrastructure. By installing a legitimate tool such as Weave Scope the attackers reap all the benefits as if they had installed a backdoor on the server, with significantly less effort and without needing to use malware. To install Weave Scope on the server the attackers use an exposed Docker API port and create a new privileged container with a clean Ubuntu image. Once installed, the attackers can connect to the Weave Scope dashboard via HTTP on port 4040 and gain full visibility and control over the victim\u2019s infrastructure. To protect yourself from this attack we recommend to: - Close exposed Docker API ports: This attack takes advantage of a common misconfiguration of the Docker API which gives the attacker full control over the Docker service. Therefore, Docker API ports should be closed or contain restricted access policies in the firewall. Block incoming connections to port 4040: Weave Scope uses default port 4040 to make the dashboard accessible and anyone with access to the network can view the dashboard. Update from Weave Works . Weave Works has since provided this in-depth article on how to prevent malicious attacks using Weave Scope","labels":"['T1133']"}
