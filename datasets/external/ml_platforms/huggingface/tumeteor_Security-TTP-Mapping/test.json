Summary Unit 42 has discovered a new malware family we\u2019ve named \u201cReaver\u201d with ties to attackers who use SunOrcal malware. Reaver is also somewhat unique in the fact that its final payload is in the form of a Control panel item, or CPL file. While we don\u2019t have information on the intended targets in this case, previous reports on this activity have identified targeting primarily among the \u201cFive Poisons\u201d which are movements the Chinese government perceives as dangerous. Reaver Malware Analysis To date, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has identified 10 unique samples and three distinct variants of a new malware family we have named \u201cReaver\u201d. As such, we identify each variant as Reaver.v1, Reaver.v2, and Reaver.v3. The flow for Reaver is as shown: Figure 1 Reaver execution flow diagram . Reaver.v1 The earliest variant of Reaver begins by attempting to enable the SeDebugPrivilege privilege for the running process. A shortcut file is generated in the following path: - %TEMP%\\~Update.lnk This \u2018~Update.lnk\u2019 file is then copied to a filename of \u2018Windows help.lnk\u2019, which is placed in the startup path previously identified. It will specifically load this CPL file via a call to the built-in Microsoft Windows \u2018control.exe\u2019 utility. Data that is sent is compressed and then base64-encoded before being included in the requests. The following example Python code shows how this encryption takes place: After this data is exfiltrated, the malware expects 8 bytes of data that contains two DWORDs.

A variety of infection artifacts are utilized ranging from bespoke tools (IndigoDrop) to customizable adversarial tools (Cobalt Strike beacons).

The use of military-themed maldocs (lures) indicates that government and military organizations in South Asia may be the targets of this threat actor. The maldocs contain bonafide content and are most likely weaponized copies of benign documents known to peek the interests of their targets. The attack variants discovered over time show us that the threat actor can evolve their TTPs in a short period of time. The earliest observable campaigns of this actor date back to April 2018 and continue to operate today along with the most recent evolutions of the attacks. Evidence of rapid ideation, testing and production of new and diversified modules and IndigoDrop iterations indicates highly motivated and agile adversaries. The use of adversarial frameworks like Cobalt Strike suggests that the attackers are looking to expand their malicious arsenal at a significant rate with self-authored and customizable artifacts. Modern-day malware attack chains consist of multiple stages and operational entities. These artifacts and entities may be hosted locally or on remote servers.
