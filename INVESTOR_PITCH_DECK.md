## The Problem: A $2 Trillion Enterprise Security Crisis

### Three Converging Threats

#### 1. The Quantum Computing Threat ($1T at Risk)

- **2030**: Quantum computers break RSA-2048, ECDSA (projected)
- **Today**: "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks happening now
- **$8.3 Trillion** in critical infrastructure vulnerable

| System | Current Encryption | Quantum Vulnerable | Timeline |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Banking Systems** | RSA-2048, ECDSA | 100% vulnerable | 2030-2035 |
| **Power Grids** | Legacy crypto | 100% vulnerable | 2030-2035 |
| **Healthcare** | RSA, AES-128 | 90% vulnerable | 2030-2035 |
| **5G Networks** | Current PKI | 100% vulnerable | 2030-2035 |

#### 2. The Protocol Integration Crisis ($500B Spent Annually)

- **10,000+ proprietary protocols** in enterprise systems
- **6-12 months** manual reverse engineering per protocol
- **$500K-$2M** cost per protocol integration
- **No automated solutions** available today

**Current Reality**:
```
Enterprise A (Banking)     Enterprise B (Supplier)
     ↓                           ↓
Different Protocols         Different Systems
     ↓                           ↓
Manual Integration (6-12 months, $2M cost)
     ↓
Custom Code (breaks with updates)
```

#### 3. The Security Operations Crisis ($200B Market)

- **3.5 million** unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally
- **24/7 human analysts** required for threat response
- **Average response time**: 2-4 hours for security incidents
- **Manual compliance** costs $2M-$10M annually per enterprise

### Current "Solutions" Don't Work

| Approach | Problem | Annual Cost |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Rip & Replace** | 10-15 year timelines | $500B-$1T globally |
| **Manual Protocol Integration** | 6-12 months per protocol | $500K-$2M per protocol |
| **Custom Security Tools** | Fragmented, point solutions | $50M-$200M per enterprise |
| **Human Security Teams** | Shortage, slow response | $150K-$300K per analyst |
| **Manual Compliance** | Error-prone, expensive | $2M-$10M annually |

**The market needs a unified AI-powered platform that solves all three crises.**
